# MCPVOT Mini-App

> A comprehensive blockchain terminal and ecosystem showcase built for the Base network and Farcaster mini-apps. MCPVOT delivers real-time trading telemetry, wallet tools, and immersive retro styling with integrated VOT/MAXX token analytics, gas estimation, and social intelligence from Farcaster casts.
MCPVOT bootstraps a shared identity layer by orchestrating RainbowKit wallets, Basename resolution, and Neynar-backed Farcaster auth. The console binds on-chain addresses to readable Basenames and streams live data including MAXX/VOT pricing, trading analytics, wallet balances, and mission feeds sourced from Farcaster.
Key integrations include:
- Base chain via Wagmi + RainbowKit for wallet connectivity
- Farcaster identity through Neynar SDK for social features
- OnchainKit for Basename lookups and enhanced UX
- Real-time data from DexScreener, Birdeye, and Base RPC
- Retro cyberpunk UI with Three.js visual effects
